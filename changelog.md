- Added Difficulty curve
  - More score -> Faster game using fps. Probably not the best.
- Renamed files
  - draw.rs -> drawing.rs
- Removed unused functions
  - drawing.rs (draw_fruit)
- Fixed some bugs with gen_range
  - rng.gen_range(0, width as i32) -> rng.gen_range(0..width as i32)
  - rng.gen_range(0, height as i32) -> rng.gen_range(0..height as i32),
- Removed comments
- Added Wall Collision -> Death
  - For some reason the snake just teleported in the old code. Removed this
- Fixed some responsivity
  - Made all keypresses work if the game is running rather than only if the tail is corrected
    - Update the tail if the tail isnt updated :)
- Version updates
  - piston_window 0.121.0 -> 0.127.0
  - rand 0.6.5 -> 0.8.5
